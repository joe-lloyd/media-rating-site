# Angel Beats!

An emotional roller coaster that blends high-octane action with lighthearted comedy and deep philosophical questions about life, regret, and the afterlife. Produced by P.A. Works and written by Jun Maeda, the series is renowned for its beautiful animation, memorable soundtrack, and a tear-jerking finale that leaves a lasting impact.

The story follows Otonashi, who awakens with no memories in an afterlife school populated by students who refused to pass on due to their regrets. He joins the Afterlife Battlefront in their fight against "Angel," the student council president, only to discover a much deeper truth about the world he now inhabits.

I thought that the series was missing some context fro a lot of the characters and then i read that it was originally suppsosed to be twice as long. I also found most of the episodes to be kinda mid tier anime like 6/10. But that being said, the finale & the spisode where Yui passes on were really good but somehow felt unearned bceause I didnt see the relationship having time to grow into something. But I did still really enjoy it the music is like 10/10 and the animation is beautiful espcially considering its 16 eyars old at this point. I guess I just wanted more and more interesting stuff rather than what we got with the OVAs, since the opperations are kinda the most boring part of the series. 

More exploration of the side characters would be great and I wanna see why Yui and Hinata fell in love. I also want to see why/how Otonashi fell in love with Kanade, because she barely says 2 word to him the whole series. I mean, that didnt stop me shedding a few tears when she disapears in his arms at the end but I feel like it wasnt earned. My critisism here sounds like I hate it or something but I alcually really like the show, the vibe the feeling it gave me, and the music is so so good.

We are unlikely to get anything more from this series which is sad but its still pretty good overall.
