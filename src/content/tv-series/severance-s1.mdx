Love the show, unique concept expertly acted and brought to life by the cast and crew.

I had originally rated it higher 9/10 but found out that they didn't know what they were going to do with the goats, its was just
random for random sake. Kinda makes me feel like the show is not built of a solid foundation, and sort of gave me an ik when
everything else feels so deliberate.

Still, great show, thoroughly enjoyed it.
