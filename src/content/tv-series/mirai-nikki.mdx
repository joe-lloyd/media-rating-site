# Mirai Nikki (Future Diary)

A psychological thriller anime that follows a unique survival game concept where participants use future-predicting diaries to eliminate each other. The series is known for its intense plot twists, dark themes, and the iconic character Yuno Gasai, who has become one of anime's most memorable yandere characters.

The show originally aired from October 2011 to April 2012, with an additional OVA titled "Mirai Nikki: Redial" released in 2013 to provide further closure to the story.

The writing is chocolate ass-cream, theres a bunch of plotholes and the characters are inconsistent. But it hits right, i cant explain it. Melodrama, violence and gore, dark themes and a unique survival game concept make it fun and compelling watch for me. Yuno Gasai being bat shit crazy yandere is the best part of the show. So entertaining even if its goofy as fuck a lot of the time.
