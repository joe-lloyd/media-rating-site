<SpoilerAlert />

Severance Season 2 is great, I really enjoyed the continuation of the story, its weird and entertaining. But i found some things to be more
contrived and reactions that didn't sync up. Like the first time the innies get to sleep or see snow or have sex, in season one
it would have been a bigger deal in the story. The idea that Mr.Milchick could be tricked into going into the bathroom and
locked in was pretty goofy.

I feel like as we learn more and things get demystified, the show loses some of its intrigue. You never wanna see how the sausage is made.

That said, I really enjoyed the show, and the ending was great. Being torn between wanting Helly and Mark S to be happy together
but also wanting to see Mark reunited with Gemma is a great mind fuck.
