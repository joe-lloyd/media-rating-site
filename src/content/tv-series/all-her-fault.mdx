# All Her Fault

A gripping mystery thriller miniseries based on Andrea Mara's 2021 novel of the same name. The show premiered on Peacock in the United States and Sky/NOW in the UK and Ireland in November 2025.

Starring Emmy-winner Sarah Snook (Succession) as Marissa Irvine, the series delivers a tense psychological drama that explores the lengths a mother will go to find her missing child, while uncovering disturbing truths about her own family. With a stellar ensemble cast including Dakota Fanning, Jake Lacy, and Michael Peña, the series keeps viewers guessing until the final episode.

I found it interesting but not outstanding overall. But definitly has great characters and a good plot.
