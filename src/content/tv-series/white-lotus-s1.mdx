# The White Lotus (Season 1)

The White Lotus is a social satire set at an exclusive Hawaiian resort. The first season follows the vacations of several hotel guests over the span of a week as they relax and rejuvenate in paradise. But with each passing day, a darker complexity emerges in these picture-perfect travelers, the hotel's cheerful employees, and the idyllic locale itself.

## Personal Rating

I rated this season 8 out of 10. Mike White's writing creates a compelling examination of privilege and class disparity with equal parts humor and discomfort.

## Standout Performances

Jennifer Coolidge delivers a career-defining performance as the emotionally unstable Tanya McQuoid, while Murray Bartlett's portrayal of the increasingly unhinged hotel manager Armond is both hilarious and tragic.

## Themes

The show brilliantly explores themes of wealth, privilege, and cultural appropriation against the backdrop of paradise, creating an uncomfortable yet captivating viewing experience.
