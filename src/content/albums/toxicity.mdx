# Toxicity by System of a Down

Toxicity is the second studio album by System of a Down, released in 2001. It catapulted the band to mainstream success and is widely regarded as one of the most influential metal albums of the early 2000s.

## Personal Rating

I rated this album 9 out of 10. The combination of Serj Tankian's unique vocal style, politically charged lyrics, and the band's technical proficiency makes this an outstanding metal album that still sounds fresh decades later.

## Standout Tracks

- "Chop Suey!" - My favorite track on the album
- "Toxicity" - The title track is a perfect encapsulation of the band's sound
- "Aerials" - Showcases the band's more melodic side

## Production

Produced by Rick Rubin, the album has a raw yet polished sound that perfectly complements the band's energetic performances.
