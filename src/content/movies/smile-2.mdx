<SpoilerAlert />

I was really looking forward to Smile 2 since I loved the first one. It's been a while since I was properly scared by a movie and Smile did that perfectly.
But Smile 2 was not as scary, I would say the opening "one take" was the best part of the movie, or perhaps some of the hallucinations that take place in
Skye's apartment.

I did still really like the movie. But I feel like the pacing was a bit slow and in the end it felt dangerously close to "it was all a dream".
Acting, special effects and gore were all top. The dark humor is my kind of humor.
