<SpoilerAlert />

Acting was solid all round, story was interesting, some very funny moments, more at the start. 
Could be more scary, and it also left me wanting more info, like how did he get the women in the basment.
Were they tricked just like the missionaries?

Ending is pretty tragic, seems like everyone died.
