## My Thoughts

Smile delivers effective scares through its unsettling premise about trauma manifesting as a supernatural entity. The film's strength lies in its atmosphere of dread and Sosie Bacon's committed performance as a woman struggling with her deteriorating mental state.

The movie uses the smiling motif to create genuinely disturbing imagery that stays with you after watching. While some horror tropes are familiar, the execution is fresh enough to make this a standout in recent horror cinema.
