# Scream

Scream is a 1996 slasher film directed by Wes Craven and written by Kevin Williamson. The film follows Sidney Prescott, a high school student in the fictional town of Woodsboro, who becomes the target of a mysterious killer known as Ghostface.

## My Thoughts

Scream revolutionized the horror genre by combining genuine scares with self-aware humor and meta-commentary on slasher film tropes. The film's success lies in its ability to both honor and subvert horror conventions while delivering genuinely suspenseful sequences.

Neve Campbell's performance as Sidney Prescott gives the film emotional weight, while the supporting cast creates memorable characters. The whodunit element keeps viewers guessing until the end, and the Ghostface killer has become one of horror's most iconic villains.

Over 25 years later, Scream remains remarkably fresh and influential, proving that horror can be both intelligent and entertaining.
