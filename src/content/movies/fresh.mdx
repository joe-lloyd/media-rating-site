Fresh is a 2022 horror-thriller film directed by Mimi Cave in her directorial debut. The story follows Noa (Daisy Edgar-Jones), who meets the alluring Steve (Sebastian Stan) at a grocery store and, given her frustration with dating apps, takes a chance and gives him her number.

I rated this movie 7 out of 10.

## My Thoughts

Fresh offers a disturbing yet darkly comedic take on modern dating horrors, starting as a romantic comedy before taking a shocking turn into cannibalistic territory. The film excels at building tension through its first act misdirection, and both Edgar-Jones and Stan deliver compelling performances.

The movie cleverly uses its premise as a metaphor for how women are often treated as commodities in the dating world. While some of the plot elements become predictable in the third act, the stylish direction and strong performances keep it engaging throughout.

The blend of genuine horror, social commentary, and black comedy makes Fresh a memorable entry in the contemporary horror landscape.
