Silent Hill 2 has been on my list for a long long time. I was always much more into the Resident Evil series growing up and had some default resistance to silent hill like it was some kind of rival.
I found it difficult to stick with some modern games but Silent Hill 2 had me as soon as I did the first puzzle with the grandfather clock in the apartment building.

The puzzles are interesting, requiring real world knowledge instead of just in game stuff like the RE series. I only beat the game normal puzzles and combat. But I wish i had put the combat at least up to hard.
They give waaay too much ammo and health items on normal. Also, I used save states to finish the game since I was playing on an emulator. I pretty much only used the safe states when i died, not to cheese encounters or anything.
It kept the game moving along pretty fast, and so I was able to finish it in under 10 hours. But I think I got the worst ending, "in water".

Boss flights and enemies were too easy as well, I didn't really find a good flow to combat, maybe I would have had to explore that system deeper in harder difficulties.

All in all it's a fantastic game that I think still holds up today. It kept my attention at least.
