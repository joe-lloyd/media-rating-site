# Doom Eternal

Doom Eternal is the direct sequel to 2016's Doom reboot, continuing the story of the Doom Slayer as he battles demons that have invaded Earth. The game significantly expands on its predecessor with new movement mechanics, additional weapons, and a deeper lore.

## Personal Rating

I rated this game 9.5 out of 10. The fast-paced "combat chess" gameplay loop that forces you to constantly move, strategize, and adapt is brilliantly designed. The addition of the meat hook, dash mechanics, and resource management through glory kills creates an exhilarating experience from start to finish.

## Standout Features

- **Combat System**: The "push-forward combat" philosophy reaches new heights with added mobility options
- **Level Design**: Vertical exploration and hidden secrets reward players who venture off the beaten path
- **Soundtrack**: Mick Gordon's heavy metal score perfectly complements the frenetic gameplay
- **Art Direction**: The blend of sci-fi, hellish landscapes, and ancient architecture creates a visually stunning world

## Difficulty

The steep difficulty curve might be a barrier for some players, but the satisfaction of mastering the game's mechanics makes the challenge worthwhile. The final boss battles are particularly demanding and rewarding.
