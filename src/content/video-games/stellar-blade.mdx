Stellar Blade was a pleasant surprise. The combat feels incredibly responsive, drawing clear inspiration from Sekiro with its parry mechanics but adding its own flair with the Beta and Burst skills.

The visual design is stunning, and the soundtrack is absolutely phenomenal—one of the best I've heard in years. The story takes a while to get going but lands well in the end.

I particularly enjoyed the boss fights; they are challenging but fair, requiring you to really learn the enemy patterns.
