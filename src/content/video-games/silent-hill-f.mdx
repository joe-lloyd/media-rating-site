Silent Hill f is a bold departure for the series, setting the action in 1960s Japan. The atmosphere is thick with dread, and the floral horror aesthetic is both beautiful and grotesque.

The story, written by Ryukishi07, is complex and disturbing, as expected. It feels very different from the western-developed Silent Hill games, leaning more into Japanese folklore and psychological horror.

Gameplay-wise, it feels like a modern survival horror game. It's not as clunky as the originals but still maintains that sense of vulnerability.
